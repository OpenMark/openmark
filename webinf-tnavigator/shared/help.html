<h1>Help information</h1>

<p> This page gives general guidance on how to enter your answers to questions.
It does not provide help with the subject matter of the questions.</p>

<p>Note that the labels on some buttons in your test may differ from the exact
text given here, for example <b>enter answer</b> instead of <b>check</b>. The
buttons still function in the same way.</p>

<h2>Entering your answers</h2>

<p>In many questions you will be asked to type your answer into
one or more blank boxes. Simply click on the box and type.</p>

<img style="width: 198px; height: 66px;" src="images/edit.jpg" alt="A question showing typing text">
<p> When required, you can enter superscripts and/or
subscripts by pressing the up or down arrow keys or by clicking
on boxes labelled superscript or subscript.</p>

<p><img style="width: 261px; height: 96px;" src="images/superscript.jpg" alt="A question showing typing using superscripts"></p>
<p>To enter a number in scientific notation you can write
the multiplication as an upper or lower case letter <b>X</b> or as <b>*</b>.</p>

<p>You may also wish to enter fractions.  To do so you should use the <b>/</b> key
on your keyboard.
For example, if you want to enter a half then you should type <b>1/2</b>.
Do not use superscripts or subscripts to enter fractions.</p>

<p>Negative numbers and subtractions can be indicated using the <b>'-'</b>
(hyphen or minus) key.</p>

<p>The left and right cursor arrow keys move left
and right in the answer. If the box has more than one line, then you
can type more than one line (and use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Return</span>
key to create line breaks).</p>

<h2>Using radio buttons</h2>

<img style="width: 303px; height: 40px;" src="images/radios.jpg" alt="Four radio buttons">
<p>
Radio buttons like these require you to select a single option. Click on the button you want
to select.
</p>
<p>If you need to use the keyboard instead, press <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tab</span>
or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Shift-Tab</span> until one of the radio buttons is highlighted.
Then use arrow keys (&uarr;, &darr; or &larr;, &rarr;) to change the selection.</p>

<h2>Using tick boxes</h2>

<img style="width: 164px; height: 103px;" src="images/ticks.jpg" alt="Question with two tick boxes">
<p>Sometimes you may be asked to choose multiple options using tick boxes.
To choose an option, click on the box next to that option. Click on the box again
to turn it off.</p>

<p>To choose options without using the mouse, press <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tab</span>
or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Shift-Tab</span> until the option you require is highlighted.
Then tick or untick the selected option by pressing the space bar.</p>


<h2>Dragging boxes</h2>

<img style="width: 334px; height: 178px;" src="images/drag2.jpg" alt="A question with drag boxes">
<p>Some questions ask you to drag boxes to blank areas.
Move your mouse over the box to be dragged, press and hold the primary
mouse button (usually the left), and drag the box until it is over the
appropriate blank area. Then release the mouse button.</p>

<p>You can also do this without using the mouse.
Press <b>Tab</b> (or <b>Shift-Tab</b>) until the blank area is
highlighted. Then press the space bar to cycle
through the possible boxes until the correct one is in place.</p>

<h2>Checking your answer</h2>

<p>Click on <b>check</b> when want the system to check your answer.
Make sure that your answer to the question says exactly
what you want it to say before clicking on <b>check</b>
(and be careful not to click on <b>check</b> by mistake).
You will be given feedback on your answer.
Click on <b>try again</b> to attempt the question again.
Click on <b>next</b> to move on to the next question.</p>


<h2>Ending the test</h2>

<p>When you have completed the last question
you will be asked whether you want to submit all your answers as a completed test.
(If you have done the last question out of order you may well wish to
return to the test instead of doing this.) You can also use
the <span style="font-weight: bold;">End test</span>
button to do this before you have
attempted all the questions. </p>

<img src="images/buttons.jpg" alt="">
<p>In either case, you will be shown a summary of your answers
and asked to confirm that you really want to
end the test and submit your answers. Click
on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Submit</span>
button to do this. Your answers will not be officially
marked and counted towards your course result until
you click on this button. </p>

<h2>The 'Your answers' button</h2>

<img src="images/answers.jpg" alt="">
<p>You can click on the <b>Your answers</b> button at any time to see
a list of questions you've attempted and the answers you gave.</p>

<h2>The question list</h2>

<img style="width: 104px; height: 26px;" src="images/questions.jpg" alt="A question list"><br>

<p>The question list appears either at the left or along the
bottom of the question area. It shows all the questions in the test and
your position within them. In the above example, you have already
attempted Question 1 and you are currently
on Question 2.
</p>

<p>Some tests let you jump to another question by clicking on the
numbers.  If you do jump to a question then the question you
are currently attempting will <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span>
be marked as <b>given up</b> or <b>passed</b> and you can attempt it later. Some
tests may allow you to repeat a question, even if you have already
completed it.</p>

<p><b>Info</b> items in the question list correspond to information
pages.</p>

<h2>Accessibility and high visibility
via the Display options screen</h2>

<p>If you click on the Display options button you will be shown
a range of options to display the questions in different text sizes,
in different colours or in <b>plain mode</b>.  It is important to note that
you should use the display options of the assessment rather than
use your browser settings to change colours and text sizes.</p>

<p>If you use a screen reader such as JAWS, then you should
select the <b>plain mode</b> user interface.
If graphics are involved in the question, then these will interpreted as words.
An example of a question displayed in plain mode is given below.</p>
