Here is some copyright-free text:

To Sherlock Holmes she is always *the* woman. I have seldom heard him 
mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and 
predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion 
akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, 
were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He 
was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that 
the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a 
false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a 
gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer -
excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for 
the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate 
and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor 
which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a 
sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, 
would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such 
as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was 
the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.
 
 - from 'A Scandal in Bohemia', Arthur Conan Doyle 
 
That is probably enough of a waste of the bandwidth bill.
