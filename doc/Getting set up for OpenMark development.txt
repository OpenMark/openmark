How to get set up for OpenMark development at the OU

Note, relative paths are within this project. Assumes Windows, but with suitable
changes should work on any OS.


1. Install a recent JDK and Tomcat.

2. Work out which code editor/IDE you will use, and hence where your working
copy of the code should be.

3. Check the project out from git. If you are reading this file, you have
probably already got that far! The repository URL is currently
        http://tjh238@csr-tfsclt-live.open.ac.uk:8080/tfs/IT_Development_Live/LearningMediaAndCollaboration/_git/LMC_Repo_OpenMark

4. Work out where you want to put extra files related to the test install that
will be running on your computer. The following assumes you will use C:\Temp.

5. Copy samples/tests/testbank -> C:\Temp\testbank

6. Copy samples/tests/questionbank -> C:\Temp\questionbank

7. Create an empty folder C:\Temp\om-logs

8. Copy misc/localhost.om-tn.xml ->
        C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 7.0_ApacheTomcat7\conf\Catalina\localhost\om-tn.xml
(With the appropriate path for your version of Tomcat.)

9. Edit that file, to make it work for your computer. (The bits you are likely to
need to change have TODO in them, like TODO-your-email.

10. If you are using Postgres, copy lib/postgresql/postgresql-8.2-505.jdbc3.jar
        -> C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 7.0_ApacheTomcat7\lib

11. Copy build.local-ou.properties -> build.local.properties.

12. Make any edits to that file that seem necessary.

13. Right-click on build.xml, chooose Run as -> Ant build .... Select the
localhost-install target, and run it.

14. Visit URLs like
    * http://pcd[TODO].open.ac.uk:8080/om/
    * http://pcd[TODO].open.ac.uk:8080/om-qe/services/check
    * http://pcd[TODO].open.ac.uk:8080/om-qe/services/Om?wsdl
    * http://pcd[TODO].open.ac.uk:8080/om-qe/services/Om
    * http://pcd[TODO].open.ac.uk:8080/om-tn/!status/check
    * http://pcd[TODO].open.ac.uk:8080/om-tn/!status
    * http://pcd[TODO].open.ac.uk:8080/om-tn/mu120.module5/
    * http://pcd[TODO].open.ac.uk:8080/om-tn/singlequestion.question01/
and hopefully it all works.
