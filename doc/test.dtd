	Rescore element works as follows:
	* If none are included, question/group has its natural scores on all axes
	* If some are included then they fully define the total scores (all not used
	  in a <rescore> are discarded)
	* Each <rescore> element adds marks to the new score, so you can use several
	  to create weighted proportions
		
	marks=: Total marks which can be added to the new ('target') score. 
	  Calculated as a proportion of the 'source' score. All calculations are in
		floating point, but the number must be an integer.
  axis=: Target axis to which marks will be added. If omitted, uses default
	  axis.
	fromaxis=: Source axis from which the proportion of previous marks is 
	  calculated. If omitted, uses default axis. 

  Note that question metadata will define the axes that the question produces,
	and available marks on each. We expect a large majority of questions to give 
	marks on only a single (default) axis.
