Unit tests in OpenMark
======================

The OpenMark unit tests are written using the JUnit 4 framework.

There are various ways to run the tests. That is one of the features of JUnit.
Some options include running them from the command line, running them from Ant,
or running them from inside an IDE. Some of the options are documented below.
