	<h2>Using graphs</h2>
	<h3>Overall system</h3>
	<p>
		A graph consists of a {@link om.graph.World} object. This specifies how
		'world co-ordinates' map to pixel co-ordinates. The World object doesn't
		actually contain a bitmap; instead, you can call its paint method to render
		it on any graphics context.
	</p>
	<p>
		Within the world there are any number of graph items (Java objects based on
		{@link om.graph.GraphItem}). These graph items include axes, lines,
		rectangles, functions, and so on. When you paint the world, each item is
		painted in turn (so that later items are painted on top).
	</p>
	<p>
		(Graphs in Om are provided as part of {@link om.stdcomponent.CanvasComponent}.
		Inside &lt;canvas&gt; you can have any number of &lt;world&gt; tags. The
		canvas will look after painting your worlds.)
	</p>
	<h3>XML vs Java code</h3>
	<p>
		The easiest way to create a graph is in XML. Here is an example:
	</p>
<pre>&lt;world id="w1" px="0" py="0" pw="200" ph="200"
	xleft="0.0" xright="1.0" ytop="1.0" ybottom="0.0">
	&lt;rectangle x="0" y="0" width="1" height="0.5" fillColour='text'/&gt;
&lt;/world&gt;</pre>
	<p>
		You could also create the same graph in Java code. Here is the Java code
		that would create the rectangle (assuming the world w had already been
		created):
	</p>
<pre>RectangleItem ri=new RectangleItem(w);
ri.setX(new GraphScalar(0.0));
ri.setY(new GraphScalar(0.0));
ri.setWidth(new GraphScalar(0.0));
ri.setHeight(new GraphScalar(0.0));
ri.setFillColour(w.convertColour("text"));
w.add(ri);</pre>
	<p>
		As you can see this is deeply tedious. If there is any actual interest in
		creating items in code, I'll create default constructors with common
		parameters.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you give items an id parameter then you can obtain them from the World
		and manipulate them in Java. This is necessary for items that take
		parameters you can't specify in XML, such as functions.
	</p>
	<h3>XML to Java mapping, or 'where's the XML format documentation?'</h3>
	<p>
		Documentation for each item is in its javadoc. The name of an item class
		is always the same as its tag, but with the first letter capitalised, and
		'Item' added to the end. For example, &lt;xAxis&gt; is the Java class
		XAxisItem.
	</p>
	<p>
		All the XML tags are empty (they contain no content, only attributes). The
		attributes translate directly to Java set() methods. For example, the
		id attribute becomes setID(), lineColour becomes setLineColour(). etc. The
		syntax of the attribute value depends on the parameter accepted by the
		Java set method:
	</p>
	<table border='1' cellpadding="4">
		<tr><th>Java type</th><th>Attribute value</th></tr>
		<tr><td>int</td><td>An integer e.g. "16" or "-4".</td></tr>
		<tr><td>double</td><td>A number e.g. "3" or "0.78" or "1.0e-10".</td></tr>
		<tr><td>String</td><td>Any string (but see restrictions in the function
			Javadoc, in some cases).</td></tr>
		<tr><td>boolean</td><td>"yes" or "no".</td></tr>
		<tr><td>GraphScalar</td><td>A graph co-ordinate, usually a simple double
			e.g. "8" or "0.4", but may also be a double followed by a colon then an integer e.g.
			"5.7:-4"; this latter gives the position as 5.7 in world co-ordinates
			minus 4 pixels.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>GraphRange</td><td>A range of graph co-ordinates from one world
			co-ordinate to another, e.g. "0.5,1.0" means everything between 0.5 and
			1.0 (inclusive). Can also be a single point, e.g. "0.0".</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Color</td><td>A colour constant from the following:
		  "fg" (normally black); "bg" (normally a pastel);
		  "whitebg" (normally white); "graph1","graph2","graph3"
		  (normally various colours). You may also use an HTML-style colour but if
		  you do you should follow it with a comma and a constant, for accessibility
		  purposes. E.g. "#ff0080,fg", "#ccc,bg". Be careful to ensure that lines
		  are distinguishable without using colour alone e.g. use different
		  thickness.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Font</td><td>Takes the format [bold/italic] [{integer}px] [fontname],
			with all elements being optional. For example, "bold", "italic 28px Verdana",
			"20px". Consult with sam before specifying a font other than "Verdana" or
			"Times New Roman" since the server needs to have fonts installed; it's
			best not to specify a font name at all unless you need to.</td></tr>
	</table>
	<h3>Reuse</h3>
	<p>
		Graphs are included in Om as part of {@link om.stdcomponent.CanvasComponent},
		but the package has been designed for reuse with no dependencies on the rest
		of the platform.
