Standard question components provided by the Om system to work with the standard
question implementation in {@link om.stdquestion}.
<p/>
These components (all subclasses of QComponent) implement the default XML tags
that are allowed in question.xml. Components have a Java file and may also have
a CSS and JavaScript file of the same name; if included, these will be
automatically placed into output which uses the component.
<h2>Creating new components</h2>
<p/>
Components are listed in ComponentRegistry.java and new components created in
this package should be added to the list in there, as well as the index of XML
tags in package.html for {@link om.stdquestion}.
