<h1>URLs served by the various servlets</h1>

<p>This page lists the URLs that each servlet will serve, with brief notes about
where in the code each one is handled.</p>


<h2>Developer servlet</h2>

<dl>
<dt>/</dt>
<dd>This page shows a list of questions that have been defined, with links to
build or run each one. It also shows a form to add new question definitions,
which posts back to the same URL. All this is handled by
<code>om.devservlet.DevServlet.handleFront</code>. Question definitions are
stored in XML files in the <code>questions</code> folder inside the developer
servlet webapp folder.</dd>

<dt>/build/<i>question package name</i>/</dt>
<dd>Builds a question. This generates a .jar fild with the same name as the XML
file defining the question. On success, redirects to the run URL below.</dd>

<dt>GET /run/<i>question package name</i>/</dt>
<dd>Start a new attempt at the specified question.</dd>

<dt>GET /run/<i>question package name</i>/v<i>N</i></dt>
<dd>Start a new attempt at a specific random variant of the question.</dd>

<dt>POST /run/<i>question package name</i>/</dt>
<dd>Continue the existing question session - that is, work through the
question, answering it.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The GET /run/ URLs support the following query strings:</p>

<dl>
<dt>access=plain</dt>
<dd>Restart the question in plain mode</dd>
<dt>access=bw</dt>
<dd>Restart the question in monochrome (green on black) mode.</dd>
<dt>access=big</dt>
<dd>Restart the question at 200% zoom.</dd>
<dt>save</dt>
<dd>Save the HTML, CSS and resource file for the curret question in the current state
in the <code>save</code> folder within the developer servlet webapp. This is to help
with debugging HTML, CSS and JavaScript problems.</dd>
</dl>
