<h1>OpenMark database structure</h1>

<p>The OpenMark database stores progress and results for all users.</p>

<p>SQL commands to create the database are in createdb.sql in the appropriate
om.tnavigator.db.<i>dbtype</i> package.</p>

<h2>Basic concepts</h2>

<p>Each user attempting a test gets a <b>test instance</b> ID - <tt>ti</tt> -
which refers to that test attempt. (Supposing they are permitted to attempt the
same test more than once, they will get a second, different <tt>ti</tt>.)</p>

<p>Each question attempt that a user begins is assigned a <b>question instance</b>
ID - <tt>qi</tt> - which refers to that particular attempt at that particular
question. Again, these numbers are unique and a second attempt at a question,
if permitted, will result in a second <tt>qi</tt>.</p>

<p>When users attempt a question, they go through a series of <b>actions</b>
which correspond to HTTP form posts (i.e. one action for each time they click
a button on the question). Each action is assigned a <tt>seq</tt> (sequence)
within that question instance.</p>

<p>A <b>question ID</b> is a unique ID for a particular question within the
question bank (e.g. <tt>s151.chapter03.question01</tt>). Questions have major
and minor version numbers.</p>

<h2>Database usage</h2>

<p>All information is stored for users on all tests (even non-assessed ones),
the only exception being single questions - the sort that appear within an
iframe on some other website - which are not stored anywhere.</p>

<p>The information is used:</p>

<ul>
<li> To restart the test from the same position (including ensuring the same
state of any questions that were started) if the user leaves and returns later.</li>
<li> To check e.g. that a user hasn't already taken the test.</li>
<li> In conjunction with the test XML file and question metadata, to calculate
user results.</li>
<li> To provide other reports on tests.</li>
<li> As a low-level logging facility so we can check exactly what happened to a
particular user if necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tables</h2>

        width="824" height="557" /></p>

<h3>nav_tests</h3>

<p>Includes one line for each user's attempt at a test (test instance).</p>

<dl>
<dt> ti&nbsp;</dt><dd> Unique ID for this 'test instance'</dd>
<dt> oucu&nbsp;</dt><dd> OUCU of user</dd>
<dt> deploy&nbsp;</dt><dd> Deploy file ID of test they're taking</dd>
<dt> rseed&nbsp;</dt><dd> Random number seed the user was assigned</dd>
<dt> attempt&nbsp;</dt><dd> Which attempt it is, e.g. 1 if this is their
first attempt at the test</dd>
<dt> finished&nbsp;</dt><dd> 1 if they clicked 'submit test', 0 if they didn't</dd>
<dt> clock&nbsp;</dt><dd> Time that they started the test</dd>
<dt> admin&nbsp;</dt><dd> 1 if they had admin access to the test, 0 if they didn't</dd>
<dt> pi&nbsp;</dt><dd> PI of user - we store this in addition to OUCU since
although you can get one from the other, it requires authenticating to a
webservice blah blah so it's generally easier to keep both</dd>
<dt> variant&nbsp;</dt><dd> Only used for testing; stores the question
variant that user selected to view. NULL if they didn't fix a variant</dd>
<dt> testposition&nbsp;</dt><dd> Position within test, including questions
and info pages. (0 = initial intro page, etc.)</dd>
<dt> finishedclock&nbsp;</dt><dd> Time at which test was submitted (if
finished is 1, otherwise null)</dd>
<dt> navigatorversion&nbsp;</dt><dd> The version of the test navigator
that started this attempt. Introduced in version 1.3.1. Existing test
attempts were set to navigatorversion = 1.3.0.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The random number seed is important. That same rseed, plus the question
attempt number for a given question (usually 1 if it's the first try), is
given as the initial random number seed to a question. It is vital when
reproducing results of a question.</p>

<p>The 'finishedclock' field was added later and, to reduce change risk, does
not replace the finished field even though it duplicates that information (i.e.
we could use the 'finishedclock IS NULL' compare instead of finished=0). At
some later date it would be good to get rid of the finished field but this
requires careful consideration.</p>

<h3>nav_testquestions</h3>

<p>For each test instance, lists all the questions that a user was given,
along with other information from the test file - the required major version,
and the name of the section it's in. Used when calculating results and in
displaying the answer summaries etc.</p>

<dl>
<dt> ti&nbsp;</dt><dd> Test instance (<i>from nav_tests</i>)</dd>
<dt> questionnumber&nbsp;</dt><dd> Sequence within the test (i.e. question number)</dd>
<dt> question&nbsp;</dt><dd> Question ID</dd>
<dt> requiredversion&nbsp;</dt><dd> Required major version of question
(from test file)</dd>
<dt> sectionname&nbsp;</dt><dd> Section name for question (from test file)</dd>
</dl>

<p><i>Note: the <b>seq</b> field currently shares name with another field. I
will be renaming this one shortly.</i></p>

<h3>nav_infopages</h3>

<p>The info pages table lists info pages that users have already seen. It's
only needed so that we can draw them purple when people resume the test. For
questions, we don't need to store this individually because we can use
nav_questions to determine whether each question was finished.</p>

<p>Each line added to this table represents an info page that somebody has
seen. If it's in here, they've seen it.</p>

<dl>
<dt> ti&nbsp;</dt><dd> Test instance (<i>from nav_tests</i>)</dd>
<dt> testposition&nbsp;</dt><dd> Position within text of info page</dd>
</dl>

<h3>nav_questions</h3>

<p>In a given test instance, there is one question instance for each
question that a user takes. If the user takes a question more than once
(only usually permitted in practice tests) there will be multiple rows in
this table with the same question ID, but they will have different qi numbers.</p>

<dl>
<dt> qi&nbsp;</dt><dd> Question instance</dd>
<dt> ti&nbsp;</dt><dd> Test instance (<i>from nav_tests</i>)</dd>
<dt> question&nbsp;</dt><dd> Question ID</dd>
<dt> attempt&nbsp;</dt><dd> Attempt number (1 for first attempt, used if there
are multiple rows)</dd>
<dt> finished&nbsp;</dt><dd> Whether or not they have finished the question</dd>
<dt> clock&nbsp;</dt><dd> Time they started the question at</dd>
<dt> majorversion&nbsp;</dt><dd> Major version of question</dd>
<dt> minorversion&nbsp;</dt><dd> Minor version of question</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Versioning</h4>

<p>The system stores major and minor version of the question in use to be
certain that actions are still relevant. For example, if a user starts a
question when the latest version is 1.4, but somebody then uploads 1.5,
the user's test will continue using 1.4 unless they restart the question
(for tests which allow questions to be indefinitely restarted, i.e. practice
tests rather than assessed ones).</p>

<p>This ensures that progress through the question is compatible. Otherwise,
if the action format changes slightly between versions, the system could
encounter errors when it attempted to replay existing progress through the
question.</p>

<h5>Finished</h5>

<p>Possible values for finished:</p>

<ul>
<li> 0 = not finished</li>
<li> 1 = results sent </li>
<li> 2 = question completed</li>
</ul>

<p>The distinction between 1 and 2 is that 1 means the question returned
some results (which usually happens before the question 'exits', as it tends
to display a page of information too), whereas 2 means the question was
completed totally (i.e. they clicked the button to finish on that final
information page). Generally, anything other than 0 means finished.</p>

<h3>nav_actions</h3>

<p>For each question attempt, we store each action the user takes, i.e.
each time they click on a button to post a form to the server. Basically
it stores all the form parameters. This can be used to replay a question
if necessary.</p>

<dl>
<dt> qi&nbsp;</dt><dd> Question instance (<i>from nav_questions</i>)</dd>
<dt> <b>seq</b>&nbsp;</dt><dd> Sequence for action (1 = first action)</dd>
<dt> clock&nbsp;</dt><dd> Time of action</dd>
</dl>

<p>This doesn't actually store the parameters that went with a single
action, because those are in nav_params.</p>

<p><i>Note: seq here is not the same as seq in nav_testquestions, so
don't try joining on them (I'm not sure why you would but still). Sorry!
I missed that one when tidying out the database. Will tidy again soon.</i></p>

<h3>nav_params</h3>

<p>There may be any number of parameters for each action.</p>

<dl>
<dt> qi&nbsp;</dt><dd> Question instance (<i>from nav_questions</i>)</dd>
<dt> seq&nbsp;</dt><dd> Action sequence (<i>from nav_actions</i>)</dd>
<dt> paramname&nbsp;</dt><dd> Name of parameter</dd>
<dt> paramvalue&nbsp;</dt><dd> Value of parameter (may include Unicode)</dd>
</dl>

<h3>nav_results</h3>

<p>Results are entered when a question is completed, or by the time in
the question when we've already told them the answer. There is only ever
one nav_results entry per question instance (or none at all).</p>

<dl>
<dt> qi&nbsp;</dt><dd> Question instance (<i>from nav_questions</i>)</dd>
<dt> questionline&nbsp;</dt><dd> Text summary of question (may include Unicode)</dd>
<dt> answerline&nbsp;</dt><dd> Text summary of user's answer (may include Unicode)</dd>
<dt> actions&nbsp;</dt><dd> Text summary of all user's actions
e.g. answers at each possible attempt (for admin staff; may include Unicode)</dd>
<dt> attempts&nbsp;</dt><dd> Number of attempts at question
(1 = right first time, 2 = right second time, etc.; 0 = pass, -1 = wrong)</dd>
</dl>

<h3>nav_scores</h3>

<p>Each question can return integer scores on multiple axes, which
have IDs. Consequently there might be zero, one, or more entries in
this table per question instance.</p>

<dl>
<dt> qi&nbsp;</dt><dd> Question instance (<i>from nav_questions</i>)</dd>
<dt> axis&nbsp;</dt><dd> Axis ID (may be blank - empty string, not null -
for default axis)</dd>
<dt> score&nbsp;</dt><dd> Score</dd>
</dl>

<p>Note that the maximum available score on each axis for a question is not
included in the database, but is obtained as part of the question metadata.
This is sort of questionable. Arguably, it ought to be recorded here too so
that scores can be reconstructed without needing to go back and ask individual
questions for their metadata.</p>

<h3>nav_customresults</h3>

<p>A few questions may return 'custom results' for processing by some other
system (e.g. extract from our database and dispatch the text to tutors).</p>

<dl>
<dt> qi&nbsp;</dt><dd> Question instance (<i>from nav_questions</i>)</dd>
<dt> name&nbsp;</dt><dd> Custom result ID</dd>
<dt> customresult&nbsp;</dt><dd> Custom result value, arbitrary text (may
include Unicode)</dd>
</dl>

<p>The system writes to this table only if questions actually have custom
results, and never reads it.</p>

<h3>nav_sessioninfo</h3>

<p>This table is used only for logging. It stores information about each
user test session, written when their session begins.</p>

<dl>
<dt> ti&nbsp;</dt><dd> Test instance (<i>from nav_tests</i>)</dd>
<dt> ip&nbsp;</dt><dd> IP address stored as a string (currently IPv4)</dd>
<dt> useragent&nbsp;</dt><dd> User-agent (browser) identifier</dd>
<dt> clock&nbsp;</dt><dd> Time of session start</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Database clearance</h2>

<p>At present, nothing is ever automatically deleted from this database.
Should it become necessary to delete data, care would need to be taken not
to delete data that should still be retained - assessed test data must be
kept for at least a year, I have heard.</p>
