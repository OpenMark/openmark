<h1>Release notes for OpenMark v1.6.0</h1>

<p>These are the changes since v1.4.x.</p>

<p>You can <a href="../servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=7783&amp;expandFolder=7783&amp;folderID=0">download
OpenMark v1.6.0</a> from the Documents &amp; files section of this web site.</p>

<h2>A Changes that affect question and test authors</h2>

<ol>
<li>In deploy files, you must now include a <tt>&lt;supportcontacts&gt;</tt> tag
just after <tt>&lt;definition&gt;</tt> tag, containing the contact email(s) for
the person or people responsible for the test. This allows them to be contacted
if a problem is detected with that test. For example:</li>
</ol>
<pre>
	&lt;!-- Test ID --&gt;
	&lt;definition&gt;s151.pa&lt;/definition&gt;
	&lt;supportcontacts&gt;tim@example.com&lt;/supportcontacts&gt;
</pre>
<ol>
<li>All questions components can have a <tt>lang="xx"</tt> attribute added. This
is good for accessibility (you only need to bother marking non-English content),
and also to allow different fonts for different languages.</li>
<li>New question component <tt>&lt;wordselect&gt;</tt> created by Spencer Harben.
Allows you to make questions like "Highlight all the adjectives in the following
paragraph."</li>
<li>If your question is doing something that might fail due to external
influences (e.g. trying to connect to a web service which might be down at the
time) you should throw an <tt>OmTransientQuestionException</tt> instead of an
<tt>OmDeveloperException</tt>, so we can display a better error message to
students, telling them to try again later.</li>
<li>The developer servlet now checks that starting a question with a particular
random seed will always generate exactly the same question. This catches a
common programming error by question authors.</li>
<li>A way to analyse scores by question variant. To support this, they make sure
the question includes the text "Variant = NN" in the questionline it returns,</li>
<li>New helper methods <tt>om.helper.Shuffler.shuffle(array, random)</tt>, to
properly shuffle an array of any type. I needed this in the Om system, and also
I saw some very poor shuffling code in a couple of questions. Please use the
library routine to shuffle arrays in future.</li>
</ol>

<h2>R Improvements to reports</h2>

<ol>
<li>New report that lists all the tests currently on a server. (Uses A.1 above.)</li>
<li>New report listing all the versions of all the questions currently on a server.</li>
<li>New reports giving an overview of total system usage by test and by month.</li>
<li>New variants report, see A.5 above. Available to anyone with reports access on that test.</li>
<li>Improved formatting of on-screen HTML in some reports.</li>
<li>Option to download XML reports, as well as seeing them in your browser.</li>
<li>Test attempts where the student starts the test, does not answer any
questions, and then submits, are now consistently included in the reports.</li>
</ol>

<h2>S System enhancements</h2>

<ol>
<li>OpenMark questions in Moodle now fully work using the Moodle
<a href="http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?d=13&rid=798">Opaque question type</a>.
(Or then will once I uploade the latest Opaque code.)</li>
</ol>

<h2>F Notable bug fixes</h2>

<ol>
<li>There were layout problems with iplaces and eplaces in some situations that
should now be fixed.</li>
<li>There was a null pointer exception if a student who had not submitted went
in after the close date - they should be given a few hours grace when they are
not allowed to answer any more questions, but are still able to finish test.</li>
<li>There was a problem with place-holders in drag boxes in plain mode. Many
congratulation to Fiona for finding this obscure combination!</li>
<li>Layout problem when you tried to print a question with drag-boxes.</li>
</ol>
