<h1>How to build OpenMark</h1>

<p>
This document takes you through the process from obtaining the OpenMark source,
through obtaining prerequisites, to building, and finally installing so that
you can see the samples running.
</p>

<p>
You should probably set aside about an hour for this.
</p>

<h2>1 Component overview</h2>

<p>
OpenMark consists of three servlets:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Developer servlet</strong><br />
This is used by question authors,
typically running on a Tomcat install on their own machine, to build and test
questions. It is strictly a development environment and can only handle requests
from one user at a time.</li>
<li><strong>Question engine</strong><br />
This runs question code and provides a Web service to the test navigator.
It has no user interface.</li>
<li><strong>Test navigator</strong><br />
This handles authentication, database storage, and all user interaction. Actual
question work is handed off to the question engine web service.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The single build script builds all three components.
</p>

<h2>2 Requirements</h2>

<p>
The intended reader of this document is familiar with Java web applications
(installing them, managing them in an application server like Tomcat).
</p>

<p>
You need to have these things set up before you begin. This document
doesn't tell you how to install them.
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/"><strong>Java JDK 6+</strong></a>.</li>
<li>A working Java application server such as <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org"><strong>Apache Tomcat</strong></a> running on
any operating system. <small>(Due to a bug in Mac OS X 10.3, users of this platform must be running 10.4+)</small></li>
<li><a href="http://ant.apache.org/"><strong>Apache Ant</strong></a> build system (included in most IDEs). We used 1.7.0.</li>
<li>A working <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/"><strong>PostgreSQL</strong></a> or <strong>Microsoft SQL Server</strong> database server.</li>
<li>The TrueType/OpenType <strong>fonts</strong> 'Verdana' and 'Times New Roman', in all styles.</li>
<li>A working <strong>SMTP server</strong> so that the server can send email.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Database servers</h3>

<p>Postgres and SQL Server are the only supported databases at present. It is
possible to add support for other database servers. We will not be doing this
ourselves but would appreciate contributions in this regard. See the
<tt>om.tnavigator.db</tt> package within the code.</p>

<p>You do not need a database to run the developer servlet. Only the test
navigator requires access to it.</p>

<h3>Fonts</h3>

<p>Verdana and Times New Roman are included as standard on Windows and OS X,
but users of other operating systems may need to obtain a copy of these fonts and install them in
the lib/fonts folder within your Java runtime.
(<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/intl/font.html">Information
about fonts in Java.</a>)</p>

<p>You need these fonts on any server that runs the developer servlet or
question engine. They are not needed for the test navigator servlet.</p>

<h2>3 Obtaining OpenMark source</h2>

<p>
The OpenMark code repository uses SubVersion. You can check it out without
needing a dev.java.net account.
</p>

<p>
Releases and developement snapshots are tagges according to the
<a href="versionpolicy.html">version number policy</a>. If you are interested
in developing the OpenMark system, you should check out trunk, as described below.
If you want to deplay a stable system, check out the latest stable version instead.
If you want to help with testing, check out the latest development snapshot.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Command-line checkout:<br />
<tt>svn checkout https://openmark.dev.java.net/svn/openmark/trunk openmark --username guest</tt></li>
<li>We recommend the Eclipse IDE. If you are using this, install the
<a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/">Subclipse plugin</a>. You can then check
out as follows:
<ul>
<li>File / New / Project; Checkout projects from SVN; enter the URL
<tt>https://openmark.dev.java.net/svn/openmark</tt></li>
<li>Select 'trunk' from the resulting list and click Next</li>
<li>Choose to create a new project using the wizard, and select a Java project
under Java 1.4 with source and binaries in different folders.</li>
<li>When prompted to enter a username, enter <strong>guest</strong>, no password</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>OpenMark's repository should begin to download.</p>

<small>If you are behind a web proxy, you may get a really unhelpful error from the
checkout. The solution is to edit <tt>~/.subversion/servers</tt> (MacOS, Linux) or
<tt>C:\Documents and Settings\XXXX\Application Data\Subversion\servers</tt> (Windows)
to tell SubVersion about your proxy.</small>

<h2>4 About Apache Ant</h2>

<p>Apache Ant is a build system - sort of like <tt>make</tt>, but works in
a different way. Using Ant you can define XML scripts that build a piece of
software (or do something else). We use Ant to build OpenMark.</p>

<p>In order to build OpenMark you don't need to know how Ant works but you do
need to know how to run it and how to change properties.</p>

<h3>Running Ant</h3>

<p><strong>Don't run Ant yet!</strong> You need to finish configuring the build
script first, otherwise it will fail and could potentially delete things you don't
want deleting.</p>

<ul>
<li>If Ant is installed in a typical Unix system you can run it from the command
line by changing to the directory that includes the <tt>build.xml</tt> script
and typing <tt>ant</tt>.</li>
<li>If you're using Eclipse you can run Ant by right-clicking on <tt>build.xml</tt>
and clicking 'Run as / Ant script'.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Setting properties</h3>

<p>If you're using Eclipse, you can choose extra options such as setting
properties without having to alter <tt>build.xml</tt> itself. Choose 'Run as /
Ant script...' and use the tabbed dialog. Other IDEs are likely to have similar
options.</p>

<p>It's also easy to set properties by editing the file directly. For example,
here is a snippet of the included file:</p>

<pre>
&lt;!--
  Modify Axis home. Should point to an Axis 1.4 install on the build
  machine. Used to obtain Axis lib files.
  -->
&lt;property name="axishome" value=""/>
</pre>

<p>Supposing you installed Axis in /somewhere/axis-1_4, then you could edit
the property line to read:</p>

<pre>&lt;property name="axishome" value="/somewhere/axis-1_4"/></pre>

<p>All the properties you need to edit are at the beginning of the file.</p>

<h2>5 Prerequisites</h2>

<p>
If you use Eclipse or another IDE you will probably notice a hideous number of
errors as it attempts to build the project. This is because it's missing a bunch
of prerequisite software programs from other people (Sun, Apache) which you need
to install.
</p>

<p>
The jar files contributed by these prerequisites will be built into the OpenMark
web applications as needed, so you don't need to install them in any particular
location. It's OK to just set them up in your own folder for the purpose of building.
</p>

<p>
OpenMark builds using an Ant build script <tt>build.xml</tt> which contains properties
for the location of each prerequisite. You need to edit these properties,
either by editing <tt>build.xml</tt> directly or by using facilities in your IDE to
set them up, once you've downloaded the prerequisites.
</p>

<p>
If using an IDE, you should see that there are no errors in the project after
you configure all the below prerequisites. (There are still some warnings, I'm
afraid.)
</p>

<h3>servlet-api.jar</h3>

<p>(Required for building all components.)</p>

<p>The servlet API is included in your application server. If you use Apache
Tomcat, it's in your Tomcat install folder under <tt>common/lib</tt>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Set the <tt>build.xml</tt> property <tt>servletapi</tt> to the folder that
includes this file. On my computer this is <tt>/opt/local/share/java/tomcat5/common/lib</tt>.</li>
<li>If you use an IDE, find <tt>servlet-api.jar</tt> and add it to the build path.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Apache Axis</h3>

<p>(Required to build question engine and test navigator.)</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/">Download Axis</a>. We have tested
only with Axis 1.4.</li>
<li>Unpack the software and place it somewhere (anywhere). I put
it in <tt>/Users/sam/javalibs/axis-1_4</tt>.
<li>Set the <tt>build.xml</tt> property <tt>axishome</tt> to the above folder.</li>
<li>If you use an IDE, add all the jar files from the <tt>lib</tt> folder inside
<tt>axis-1_4</tt> to the build path.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Java Activation Framework</h3>

<p>(Required to build test navigator.)</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/jaf/">Download the Java Activation Framework</a>. We have tested
only with JAF 1.1.</li>
<li>Unpack the software and place it somewhere (anywhere). I put
it in <tt>/Users/sam/javalibs/jaf-1.1</tt>.
<li>Set the <tt>build.xml</tt> property <tt>jafhome</tt> to the above folder.</li>
<li>If you use an IDE, add <tt>activation.jar</tt> from the
<tt>jaf-1.1</tt> folder to the build path.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Java Mail</h3>

<p>(Required to build test navigator.)</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/">Download Java Mail</a>. We have tested
only with Java Mail 1.4.</li>
<li>Unpack the software and place it somewhere (anywhere). I put
it in <tt>/Users/sam/javalibs/javamail-1.4</tt>.
<li>Set the <tt>build.xml</tt> property <tt>javamailhome</tt> to the above folder.</li>
<li>If you use an IDE, add <tt>mail.jar</tt> from the
<tt>javamail-1.4</tt> folder to the build path.</li>
</ol>

<h2>6 Other build settings</h2>

<p>
You may also need to set the following build options as Ant properties.
</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>build</tt><br />
Folder in which the build output is placed, along with intermediate files. Note
that this folder is <strong>completely deleted</strong> every time you build, so
be very careful! The default is <tt>/tmp/om-build</tt>.</li>
<li><tt>javadoc</tt><br />
Folder for javadoc. Javadoc only gets built when you build the 'javadoc' ant
target, it's not part of the default 'all' target. When it is built, this folder
is <strong>completely deleted</strong> and current javadoc is placed there. The
default is a <tt>javadoc</tt> folder inside the build folder.</li>
</ul>

<p>
See comments in <tt>build.xml</tt> for details of other options which basically
affect how the developer servlet is set up. The defaults should work correctly
when running the developer servlet on your own machine and you can change them
later in the developer servlet's <tt>web.xml</tt> anyway.
</p>

<h2>7 Run Ant build</h2>

<p>Run Ant to build the system. You should see output like the following:</p>

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 19 seconds
</pre>

<p>That's it; the system is now built. You can find the resulting webapps,
assuming you didn't change the default build folder, in <tt>/tmp/om-build/webapps</tt>.
They are available in both unpacked and packed .war formats.</p>

<h2>8 Install and test developer servlet</h2>

<p>The developer servlet is for question authors. It allows you
to build and test individual questions. It only supports a single user at a
time, so it's not suitable for running tests.</p>

<h3>Basic installation</h3>

<ol>
<li>Install the Web application by deploying <tt>/tmp/om-build/webapps/om.war</tt>,
or copying the <tt>/tmp/om-build/webapps/om</tt> folder in its entirety into your
application server's web application folder.</li>
<li>Visit the web application's home page in a browser. If you are using Tomcat with default
settings on the local computer this will be <a href="http://localhost:8080/om/">http://localhost:8080/om/</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>You should see:</p>

<p><img src="devservlet.png" alt="Initial screen of developer servlet" /></p>

<h3>Configuring a question</h3>

<p>A range of sample questions are included in the <tt>samples</tt> folder of
the OpenMark source tree. In order to test that the developer servlet is working
we will set it up to build one of these questions.</p>

<ol>
<li>Under 'Source tree', enter the absolute path to your copy of the
<tt>samples</tt> folder. In my system, this is <tt>/Users/sam/Documents/workspace/openmark-svn/samples</tt>.</li>
<li>Under 'Extra package', enter <tt>samples.shared</tt>. (Some questions use shared
classes from this package; entering it here means those shared classes are built
into each question).</li>
<li>By 'Package', enter the package name of a sample question, such as <tt>samples.numeric.singleentry</tt>.</li>
<li>Click Create.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This will create an XML file defining all the information needed to build the
question package, and the question should appear in the list up above.
</p>

<ul><li>If you instead get an error like
<tt>java.io.FileNotFoundException:</tt>...<tt>/om/questions/samples.numeric.singleentry.xml (Permission denied)</tt>,
then your application server does not have permission to write to the <tt>questions</tt>
folder within the developer servlet web application. Change permissions of this
folder so that the application server can write to it (for example by using the
Unix commands <tt>chown</tt> and <tt>chmod</tt>) then try again.</li></ul>

<h3>Building and running a question</h3>

<p>Click Build next to the question in the list. You should see output like the
following:</p>

<pre>
Buildfile: questionbuild.ant
compile:
[mkdir] Created dir: /Users/sam/Documents/webapps/om/questions/tempbuild
[javac] Compiling 11 source files to /Users/sam/Documents/webapps/om/questions/tempbuild
copydata:
copymeta:
[copy] Copying 1 file to /Users/sam/Documents/webapps/om/questions/tempbuild
jar:
[jar] Building jar: /Users/sam/Documents/webapps/om/questions/samples.numeric.singleentry.jar
clean:
[delete] Deleting directory /Users/sam/Documents/webapps/om/questions/tempbuild
all:
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 3 seconds
</pre>

<ul><li>
If you instead get an error like <tt>om.OmException: Error running Ant build</tt>,
then you need to check the webapp is correctly configured to point to an Ant 1.7
install. Inside the webapp, open <tt>WEB-INF/web.xml</tt> in a text editor and
alter the value of the parameter <tt>ant-home</tt>, then restart the webapp and
try again.
</li></ul>

<p>
After it successfully builds, the question will immediately run. (If there
were syntax errors, it would remain on the build page so you can see them.)
You should be able to try out answering the question and also restart the
question with various accessibility options for testing.
</p>

<h2>9 Install and test question engine and test navigator</h2>

<p>The question engine is a Web service that runs questions. The test navigator
provides a user interface, manages access permissions, and stores information
in a database.</p>

<h3>Basic installation</h3>

<p>Install the Web applications by deploying <tt>/tmp/om-build/webapps/om-qe.war</tt> and <tt>om-tn.war</tt>,
or copying the <tt>/tmp/om-build/webapps/om-qe</tt> and <tt>om-tn</tt> folders in their entirety into your
application server's web application folder.</p>

<h3>Configuring the test navigator</h3>

<p>The test navigator is configured with a file <tt>navigator.xml</tt> in the
root of the webapp. You need to modify this file, so it doesn't exist by default.
Begin by copying <tt>navigator.sample.xml</tt> to <tt>navigator.xml</tt>, then
open the file for editing.</p>

<ol>
<li>Configure your database.<ul>
<li>In your database system, create a new database for
Om (you can also reuse an existing one if you really want; all our tables begin
with <tt>nav_</tt>) and create a user that has full access to this database,
including the ability to create tables.</li>
<li>In the <tt>&lt;database></tt> configuration element, set all the values to
match your database settings (Postgres/SQL Server plugin, server address, database name,
username, and password).</li></ul></li>
<li>Set up the question engine URL.<ul><li>
Under <tt>&lt;questionengines></tt>, correct the URL of the question engine
if necessary. It should be the address of the question engine webapp followed by
<tt>/services/Om</tt>. The default is correct for a default Tomcat install.</li></ul></li>
<li>Set up the test navigator's own URL.<ul><li>
Under <tt>&lt;testnavigators></tt>, again correct the URL of the test navigator
if necessary. This should be the address of the test navigator webapp.
Again, the default is correct for a default Tomcat install.</li></ul></li>
<li>Enter email details.<ul><li>
<tt>&lt;smtpserver></tt> should point to an SMTP server that the webapp can use
to send mail.</li>
<li>The <tt>&lt;alertmail></tt> section should have a <tt>&lt;from></tt> address that the SMTP
server will accept as valid, and you should put your own address in <tt>&lt;to></tt>.</li>
<li>The server will use these details to send you email if an error message
occurs.</li></ul></li>
</ol>

<p>You probably don't need to change any of the other settings right away.
(By the way, be careful! This page tells you how to set up a system to make
sure it works, not how to secure it for production use on assessed tests.)</p>

<p>When you're done, save <tt>navigator.xml</tt> and restart the test navigator
webapp.</p>

<h3>Running the sample test</h3>

<p>To make life easier, a sample test is preinstalled. It's a test that helps
students for an Open University course determine whether they understand
simple diagrams. (Please note that the version of this test that we took to
use as a sample may not have been completely finished - it is included as an
example only and doesn't necessarily reflect the final product.)</p>

<p>The test navigator doesn't have a home page; instead you need to directly
access the test. The URL you go to includes the name of the test's 'deploy file'
inside the <tt>testbank</tt> folder. In this case, that is <tt>mu120.module5.deploy.xml</tt>
so the URL to visit, if you are using Tomcat with default configuration, is
<a href="http://localhost:8080/om-tn/mu120.module5/">http://localhost:8080/om-tn/mu120.module5/</a>.</p>

<p>The test should now begin and you should be able to try it out.</p>

<ul>
<li>If instead you get an error like: <tt>Error creating log file</tt> then you
need to ensure that the server has write access to the <tt>logs</tt> folder
inside the webapp, for example using the Unix commands <tt>chown</tt> and <tt>chmod</tt>.</li>
<li>After you fix this and begin the test you might get another error, this time from the question
engine: <tt>om.OmException: Failed to save question file</tt>. This means you
need to give the same permissions to the <tt>questioncache</tt> folder inside the
question engine webapp. (The question engine obtains copies of questions
from the test navigator, but caches them in its own folder.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>10 Building javadoc</h2>

<p>You can build javadoc API documentation for the source code - vitally
important if you want to start creating questions. This isn't built by default,
so just build the <tt>javadoc</tt> Ant target to get it.</p>

<h2>11 Where to go from here</h2>

<p>
You've got all parts of the system working - great. Now you run into the limits
of the documentation we've written. :)
</p>

<h3>Question and test creation</h3>

<p>
Existing documentation intended for University staff - and not revised - is included
in the <tt>doc</tt> folder. This includes documents for question authors (two
of them? hrm, wonder which is better), the format of the test/deployment files,
and about how you can embed Om questions inside other HTML pages.
</p>

<h3>Things you can do but we haven't documented</h3>

<p>
Apart from that you might want documentation on the following, which is already possible in
the existing system:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Core system concepts like the architecture, how questions are handled, what happens
if users close their browser and come back later, etc.</li>
<li>How to deploy a secure, robust system.</li>
<li>How to set up simple authentication so that users have to log in.</li>
<li>How to contribute code (code guidelines, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
For that you could try pestering us in the forums here and maybe we will
improve the documentation!
