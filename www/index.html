<p>OpenMark is a computer-assisted assessment (CAA) system that has its foundations
in computer-assisted learning. It was developed by
<a href="http://www.open.ac.uk">The Open University</a>, where it has been used
by thousands of students, and is now released as open source software under
the GNU General Public License.</p>

<p>OpenMark components run as standard Java web applications.</p>

<h3>Pedagogical overview</h3>

<p>OpenMark differs from traditional CAA systems in:</p>

<ul>
<li>The emphasis we place on feedback. All Open University students are
distance learners and within the university we emphasise the importance of
giving feedback on written assessments. The design of OpenMark assumes that
feedback, perhaps at multiple levels, will be included.</li>
<li>Allowing multiple attempts. OpenMark is an interactive system, and
consequently we can ask students to act on feedback that we give 'there and
then', while the problem is still in their mind. If their first answer is
incorrect, they can have an immediate second, or third, attempt.</li>
<li>The breadth of interactions supported. We aim to use the full capabilities
of modern multimedia computers to create engaging assessments.</li>
<li>The design for anywhere, anytime use. OpenMark assessments are designed to
enable students to complete them in their own time in a manner that fits with
normal life. They can be interrupted at any point and resumed later from the
same location or from elsewhere on the internet.</li>
</ul>

<h3>System overview</h3>

<p>OpenMark ('Om' for short) is very different from most question systems in that
each question contains code as well as data. Although you do not need high-level
Java abilities to create questions, this may still make it impractical for use
in organisations that don't have software development skills. (It is a long-term
goal to provide a way of defining basic 'question types' that can be created
using Web forms, like other system, as well as more advanced questions.)</p>

<h3>Creating questions</h3>

<ul>
<li>An XML language allows question
authors to create and arrange the components that make up their question (such as text,
equations, graphics, input boxes, draggable markers, audio clips).</li>
<li>Using Java, authors define how their question reacts to user input - Java
code checks the values of question components and determines which feedback to
display, which score to grant, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>A question author servlet, installed on the author's machine, allows them
to compile and test questions. You don't need to use an IDE (although you
will probably want to, just for the editing interface) or compile them by hand.</p>

<h3>Live system</h3>

<p>The live system is based around two servlets: the <strong>question engine</strong>
and the <strong>test navigator</strong>. The test navigator deals with all
direct communication with students, handles authentication, and handles details
of tests - which question comes when, any explanatory information, and so on.
Question engines deal only with the actual processing behind questions and do
not communicate directly with the user or with the database that records user
actions. All the question code runs on question engines.</p>

<p>You can run a system with one test navigator and one question engine. For
robustness, it is possible to use more than one test navigator (we run two; you'd
probably be good up to, say, five or ten). The number of question engines can
scale infinitely as they are completely independent of each other and of any
other system.</p>
