<h1>How to create a new Om report</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>There are two types of report in OpenMark: Test reports, which display
information about a particular test, and System reports, which display
system-wide information. Access to test reports is controlled through the
deploy file for the test. Access to system reports is controlled by IP address,
as configured by the &lt;trustedaddresses> and &lt;secureaddresses> tags in
the navigator.xml file.</p>

<p>A report is implemented as a Java class that implements the interface
om.tnavigator.reports.OmTestReport or om.tnavigator.reports.OmReport, or both.
All the standard reports live in the
package om.tnavigator.reports.std. You should be able to get a long way
by looking at how the existing reports work. They tend to use helper code from
the om.tnavigator.reports package. A single instance of the report class is
responsible for serving all instances of the report. Often they do this by having
and inner class that is a subclass of om.tnavigator.reports.TabularReportBase, and
creating an instance of this inner class whenever a report is requested.
Dispatching of report requests to the appropriate report class is handled by the
om.tnavigator.reports.ReportDispatcher class.</p>

<h2>What happens when the test navigator starts up</h2>

<p>When the NavigatorServlet starts up, it creates a ReportDispatcher. This loads
and creates one instance of all the known report classes. The list of classes to load
comes from two sources:</p>

<ul>
<li>Standard reports, that are part of the Om system, should be listed in the
standardReports array in the ReportDispatcher class.</li>
<li>Any additional reports that you have written should be listed in the
&lt;extrareports> section of the navigator.xml file. For example</li>
</ul>

<pre>
	&lt;extrareports>
		&lt;report>ou.CMAReport</report>
		&lt;report>ou.CMADataReport</report>
	&lt;/extrareports>
</pre>

<p>will cause the two report classes om.tnavigator.reports.ou.CMAReport and
om.tnavigator.reports.ou.CMADataReport to be loaded</p>

<h2>What happens when a report is requested</h2>

<p>If a URL starting /!report/ is recieved by the test navigator, NavigatorServlet.handle()
calls ReportDispatcher.handleReport(), which looks to see if a report class exists 
that handles the rest of the URL. If it does, it performs a check on the IP address, then calls
<i>ReportClass</i>.handleReport() method if allowed. That method is then fully
responsible for handling the request and sending back a response.</p>

<p>If a URL starting /<i>testId</i>/reports! is recieved as part of a test session,
and if the use is permitted to see reports on this test, then
NavigatorServlet.handle() calls ReportDispatcher.handleTestReport(), which
looks for a matching report class and calls <i>ReportClass</i>.handleTestReport().</p>

<h2>How a typical report, utilising TabularReportBase, works</h2>

<p>A good example of a simple report is
<a href="source/browse/openmark/trunk/src/om/tnavigator/reports/std/TestUsageReport.java?view=markup">TestUsageReport</a>.</p>

<p>The class must have a public constructor that takes a NavigatorServlet parameter,
otherwise the ReportDispatcher will not be able to create it.</p>

<p>The getUrlReportName from the OmReport interface is how URLs are translated into
calls to a particular report class. In our example getUrlReportName is implemented to
return "testusage", so URLs /!report/testusage will be handled by this report class.</p>

<p>The handleReport method (another one from the OmReport interface) simply creates an
instance of the inner TestUsageTabularReport class that extends TabularReportBase, then calls
its handleReport method to do the actual work.</p>

<p>The final interface method to imlement is isSecurityRestricted. If this returns ture,
the report will only be available to 'secure' IP addresses, otherwise it will only be 
available to 'trusted' IP addresses.</p> 

<p>So the real work is done by the subclass of TabularReportBase. TabularReportBase is
designed to make it easy to write reports that are basically a single table. It provides
facilites for outputting that table in a number of different formats (HTML, XML, CSV, ...).
There are two abstract methods you have to override: init() and generateReport().</p>

<p>The init method, as well as doing any initialisation that your report wants to do at 
this stage, must return a list of ColumnDefinitions. A column definition is just an iternal id
for this column, which can be used as a tag name in XML or a class attribute in HTML, and 
a human-readable column title.</p>

<p>The generateReport method needs to contain a loop over the rows in the report, and
for each row, call the reportWriter.printRow method. This takes an argument that is
a Map&lt;String, String> which is the data for the row - where the keys are internal ids of the
columns, and the values are what appears in the table cells of the report. As a bit
of magic, if you have a column with id 'deploy', then if you put an entry into the
row map with key deploy_link and value a URL, then when output as HTML,
the table cell will be made into a link to that URL.</p>

<p>Finally, there are a few methods on TabularReportBase you can override to tweak things.
Normally the XML version of the report will use a &lt;results> tag as the document elements,
and wrap each row in a &lt;result> tag. You can customise this by overriding the getReportTagName
and getRowTagName methods. Normally, when rendered to HTML, a format selector is output
above the report table. If you want to output additional information above your report
in HTML mode, then override extraHtmlContent. When doing this, you almost certainly 
want to call super.extraHtmlContent to generate the format selector. When overriding
extraHtmlContent, the printMessage method is useful - it just adds whatever string 
you give it, wrapped in &lt;p> tags, to the output.</p>

<p>The various formats that tabular reports can be output in is handled by subclasses of
TabularReportWriter. If you want a new format, write a new subclass, and add it to the
Format enum in TabularReportBase.</p>

<h2>Strategies for generating reports</h2>

<p>At the moment, we have some reports that report on thing in the file system
(e.g. DeployedTest and DeployedQuestions), and some
reports that report on data in the database (e.g. all the rest).</p>

<p>The simplest sort of report is one that you can generate one row at a time. Then
it is possible to do all the work inside a single loop in the the generateReport method.
For example DeployedQuestions and TestUsageReport. This is good, because it minimises
memory usage. For reports that return large amounts of data, this is the way to go,
if at all possible.</p>

<p>However, at other times, it is not possible to generate the report one row at a
time. Then you have to do some processing up-front. For example MonthlyUsageReport
has two loops in generateReport, the first stores some data in a HashMap that is then
used in the second loop to ouput the rows. VariantsTestReport is interesting in that
in advance you don't even know how many columns there should be until the report
is computed, so all teh hard work is done in the constructor, and then init and
generateReport are quite simple. Here, we know that the total report size will not be very big
(# questions in text \times; # variants per question cells, so having all that data in
memory is not a problem.</p>
