<h1>OpenMark version number policy</h1>

<p>We use a linux-like policy.</p>

<ul>
<li>Stable releases are have numbers like 1.2.0, 1.4.0, 1.6.0, and so on.</li>
<li>Minor bug and security fixes to the 1.4.0 release will be numbered 1.4.1, 1.4.2, etc.
and developed off a stable branch in subversion.</li>
<li>After the 1.4.0 release, new development will take place of a 1.5.x, series of
development snap-shots.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the status page of a running OpenMark server, the version number displayed will look like</p>
<blockquote><p>Om version: 1.4.0 (2007-05-09 18:15:11)</p></blockquote>
<p>Where the timestamp in brackets was the time the system was compiled.</p>

<p>The version number of the codebase is stored in version.properties file.</p>
