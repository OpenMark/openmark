<h1>OpenMark version number policy</h1>

<p>We use a linux-like policy.</p>

<ul>
<li>Stable releases are have numbers like 1.2.0, 1.4.0, 1.6.0, with an even second number.</li>
<li>Minor bug and security fixes to the 1.4.0 release will be numbered 1.4.1, 1.4.2, etc.
and developed off a stable branch in subversion.</li>
<li>After the 1.4.0 release, new development will take place on a 1.5.x, series of
development snap-shots, which will lead up to the 1.6.0 release.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the status page of a running OpenMark server, the version number displayed will look like</p>
<blockquote><p>Om version: 1.4.0 (2007-05-09 18:15:11)</p></blockquote>
<p>Where the timestamp in brackets was the time the system was compiled.</p>

<p>The version number of the codebase is stored in version.properties file.</p>

<p>At the moment, all the development is being done for the Open Univeristy.
Therefore, there will be a new stable version every time the
OU's live servers are updated, and a sequence of developer snapshots during
development and testing of that release. If other people join the development
effort, this will, of course, change.</p>
