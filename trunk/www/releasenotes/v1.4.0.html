<h1>Release notes for OpenMark v1.4.0</h1>

<p>These are the changes since the first version checked into the Subversion repository, which 
roughly correspons to the last in-house OU release v1.2.3.</p>

<p>You can <a href="../servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=7783&amp;expandFolder=7783&amp;folderID=0">download
OpenMark v1.4.0</a> from the Documents &amp; files section of this web site.</p>

<h2>Java 5.0</h2>

<p>OpenMark now requires at lease version 5.0 of Java. This paves the way for question
authors to use all the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/relnotes/features.html#lang">nice
new language features introduced in Java 5.0</a> like enums and generics. The system
code has been updated to take advantage of these new features. However, existing questions
and tests should still work without being recompiled.</p>

<h2>Developer servlet improvements</h2>

<p>Question authors can now define questions using more than one extra package using
the developer servlet interface. They can also remove question definitions when they
no longer need them. Finally, the developer servlet is now more tolerant when the
final '/' is left off the URL.</p>

<h2>Question component improvements</h2>

<p>There is a new component for including Flash animations in a question.
The tag is &lt;flash&gt;. See the <a href="../nonav/javadoc/index.html?om/stdcomponent/FlashComponent.html">Javadoc
for class om.stdcomponent.FlashComponent</a>.</p>

<p>You can can use a custom graphic for markers on images. See the
<a href="../nonav/javadoc/index.html?om/stdcomponent/CanvasComponent.html">Javadoc
for class om.stdcomponent.CanvasComponent</a>.</p>

<p>You can ensure that &lt;teq&gt;s don't wrap on to a new line in the middle by adding
a wrap="no" attribute in the question XML.</p>

<p>There is a new method <a href="../nonav/javadoc/om/stdquestion/QComponent.html#setDisplayOnComponentsWithId(boolean,%20java.lang.String)">setDisplayOnComponentsWithId(boolean,
String)</a> on all question components that
sets the component and all its children that have been given an id in the question.xml file, to be visible or
invisible. This is useful if, for example, you want to quickly turn off all the bits of
feedback text before selectively turning back on just the ones you want.</p>

<h2>New reports infrastructure</h2>

<p>It is now easy to write and plug-in new reports, although the only new report utilising
this so far is the one for exporting results in the format the the new gradebook in
<a href="http://moodle.org/">Moodle 1.9</a> will import. The existing reports were
refactored to use the new interface.</p>

<h2>Changes to help Moodle integration</h2>

<p>We made some minor changes to the interface between the test navigator and the question engine
so that <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Development:Open_protocol_for_accessing_question_engines">OpenMark
questions could be used in Moodle quizzes</a>.</p>

<p>As above, work done in preparation for sending results from OpenMark to the Moodle
gradebook.</p>

<h2>Wide layout</h2>

<p>There is a new layout mode for people who want to make very wide questions.
(Not really recommended.) Set navlocation to "wide", as opposed to "left" or "bottom".</p>
