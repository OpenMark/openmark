Implementation of standard Om questions.
<p/>
Most Om questions should be
subclasses of {@link om.stdquestion.StandardQuestion}. This includes support for the XML format,
question components ({@link om.stdquestion.QComponent}) and various other things.
<p/>
It is possible to create Om questions that don't use this infrastructure
by making your question implement only the interface in the 'question' package,
but that should be needed only in rare cases as it's a lot more work.
<p/>
StandardQuestion provides a way to define questions in an XML format that is documented here.
<h2>Format of question.xml</h2>
<h3>Example</h3>
Please see the question author's guide for an example and tutorial information. This file
is the definitive reference, not a tutorial.
<h3>Header</h3>
<pre>&lt;question class="samples.q1.MinusDivision" plainmode="no"
  resources="/samples/resources/"></pre>
<table border="1">
<tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Meaning</th><th>Required?</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>class</td>
<td>Full name (including package) of class that implements the Question interface.</td>
<td>Required.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>plainmode</td>
<td>If no, the question cannot be used in plain mode.</td>
<td>Optional. By default questions are accessible in plain mode.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>resources</td>
<td>Location of resource files (such as images) that are included in the question. Should
be specified as a folder name within the question .jar file, beginning and ending with /.</td>
<td>Optional. By default resources are loaded from the same folder as the question (/samples/q1/ in the
above example).</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Title</h3>
<pre>&lt;title>Dividing negative numbers&lt;/title></pre>
<p>
The &lt;title> tag is optional. It is used to define a brief title for the question. We
recommend that you include a &lt;title> in every question.
</p>
<p>
While some tests may not display question titles, including a title allows for more consistent
reuse in other test that do. It is also valuable metadata that may be used within the ECM system /
question bank.
</p>
<p>
Titles should be no more than four words long (at most!) and appropriate for display to students.
</p>
<h3>Define-component</h3>
<pre>
&lt;define-component class="my.component.Class"/>
</pre>
<p>
The &lt;define-component/> tag is optional, and can be included as many times as necessary. It is used if the
question needs to include a custom question component within its own jar file. Once the component
has been defined, its XML tag can be used further down in the file.
</p>
<h3>Scoring</h3>
<pre>
&lt;scoring>
 &lt;marks>3&lt;/marks>
 &lt;marks axis="evil">666&lt;/marks>
&lt;/scoring>
</pre>
<p>
The &lt;scoring> tag is optional. It defines the maximum number of marks available from the question.
If you don't include it then the question makes no contribution to an overall test score.
</p>
<p>
If using {@link om.helper.SimpleQuestion1}, you must set the available marks to the same as the number
of attempts (3, by default).
</p>
<p>
The second &lt;marks> entry in the above example demonstrates scoring on a particular axis. Questions
can report different scores on multiple axes; for example a language question could report scores in
spelling and punctuation on separate axes. However, most questions need only the one default axis so
generally there will be only a single &lt;marks> entry.
</p>
<h3>Layout</h3>
<pre>
&lt;layout>
 &lt;row height="340"/>
 &lt;column width="296"/>
 &lt;column width="296"/>
&lt;/layout>
</pre>
<p>
The &lt;layout> tag is required. It defines the visual organisation of the question into a grid, into
which boxes (the &lt;box> component tag, see below) can be slotted.
</p>
<p>
The above example has one row and two columns (a 2x1 grid). If you wanted to add a second row, you would
add only one extra &lt;row/> tag; this would make a 2x2 grid. In other words, column tags and row tags are
independent; you don't need to add columns within each row. The &lt;layout> defines a grid, not its
contents, and is not similar to HTML table structures.
</p>
<p>
Specified widths and heights are in pixels. Each grid row or column can be a different size. The first
height controls the topmost row, and the first width controls the leftmost column. Between rows and
columns there is an 8 pixel margin.
</p>
<ul>
<li> The total width, including all margins, must currently be 600 pixels
or under (we recommend using 600 pixels, even if you don't need it). In this case, 296+296+8 (the margin
between) = 600. Questions wider than 600 pixels will not be displayed correctly.</li>
<li> There is no
restriction on height. We currently recommend setting height
so that your question fits, with a comfortable margin.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Remainder of file</h3>
<p>
The remainder of the file consists of question components that produce the content of the question.
Typically, there would be at least two &lt;box> components, inside which other components would be placed.
Around these other components you can also include text.
</p>
<p>
Please note that this is <em>not</em> directly related to HTML. None of the tags are exactly the same as in HTML
(although some are similar). You cannot add HTML directly. Instead, only the question components generate HTML,
which has already been tested in target browsers and for accessibility.
</p>
<p>
A list of standard components is below. This shows the XML tag that is used for the component, and links to
the corresponding Javadoc page. The javadoc page is useful for two main purposes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Documentation at the top of the page lists any attributes that the component accepts inside its XML tag</li>
<li>Standard Javadoc documentation shows methods of the component, some of which might be useful to question
authors. You can call these from question code if you obtain the component object using
{@link om.stdquestion.StandardQuestion#getComponent(String)} or one of the convenience methods (getText(),
getEditField(), etc.)</li>
<li>If you need to set the properties (XML attributes) from code, you can usually do so even if there is
no specific method for setting them. Most components
define string constants for their property names. For example, you could do
<tt>getCheckbox("chk").setBoolean(CheckboxComponent.PROPERTY_CHECKED,true);</tt>, if checkboxes didn't include
a more convenient <tt>getCheckbox("chk").setChecked(true);</tt> method.
</ul>
