Code for converting a small subset of LaTeX format to XML and then for
displaying equations in the XML format (either as bitmaps or converting to XML).
This code provides the underlying behaviour of the &lt;equation&gt; and &lt;eq&gt;
question components, but could be used in other situations too.
<p/>
Begin with static methods in the Equation class for most uses.
<p/>
The '.generated' package is created by the Ant build script using JavaCC and
JJTree utilities, based on the grammar specification grammar.jjt. Don't mess
with anything in there.
