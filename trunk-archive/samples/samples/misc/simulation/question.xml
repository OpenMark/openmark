Two settings control the amount of light reaching your camera's film or digital
sensor: <emphasis>shutter speed</emphasis> and <emphasis>aperture</emphasis>. 
<gap/>
<emphasis>Shutter speed</emphasis> controls how long the camera's shutter stays 
open. The shutter is a mechanical device that prevents light from reaching the
sensor; it moves across the sensor to briefly 'open' and allow light past. 
The time of this opening is measured in seconds, but the unit is 
normally omitted; for example, <emphasis>1/30th</emphasis>. (Cameras often 
display this as simply <emphasis>30</emphasis>.)
<gap/>
<emphasis>Aperture</emphasis> refers to the size of an opening in the lens that
admits light. This can vary from a wide hole ('large' aperture) to a 
tiny one ('small' aperture). It is measured in f-numbers: <emphasis>f/1</emphasis> corresponds to a 
<emphasis>large</emphasis> aperture, while <emphasis>f/22</emphasis> corresponds to a <emphasis>small</emphasis> aperture.

 You can take pictures using the camera controls on the left. All the pictures
 are taken in the same place, with the camera focused on the juggling ball.
 Take as many pictures as you need to be sure of your answer.

 Complete the following sentence:

<emphasis>Yes.</emphasis> The picture gets <emphasis>darker</emphasis> 
when you increase shutter speed.
<gap/>
Even though shutter speed is measured in seconds, we still talk of 
it in terms of speed. 1/250th requires the shutter to move faster than 
1/30th, even though the time is shorter.
<gap/>
<button action="actionOK2n" label="OK"/>

<box gridx="1" gridy="1" id="answer2n" display="no" background="answer">
<emphasis>No.</emphasis> In fact, the picture gets <emphasis>darker</emphasis> 
when you increase shutter speed.
<gap/>
The confusion comes because we are talking about shutter <emphasis>speed</emphasis>,
but the measurement given is always a time. 1/250th requires the shutter to move
faster than 1/30th, even though this results in a shorter time.

 Now try varying the aperture. To begin with, look at the effect on the 
 entire picture rather than on specific areas.

<emphasis>Yes.</emphasis> The whole picture gets <emphasis>lighter</emphasis> 
when you increase aperture.
<gap/>
Aperture refers to the size of the opening in the lens; making this opening
wider allows more light through. An aperture of f/1.4 is larger than one of 
f/11.

Well, yes and no. The <emphasis>whole</emphasis> picture doesn't get less 
sharp when you increase aperture. Look at the juggling ball: it remains sharp 
whatever the aperture setting.

Try again, considering the picture as a whole.

 Finally, try varying the aperture while setting the shutter speed so that
 the picture stays at the same brightness (neither too bright nor too dark).
 What happens to the poster on the back wall, and the writing toward
 the back of the book?

<emphasis>No.</emphasis> You should be setting the shutter speed along with 
the aperture so that the picture remains equally bright.

Try again, looking at what happens with different aperture settings when
the brightness remains correct.
