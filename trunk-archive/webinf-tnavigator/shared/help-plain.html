  <h1>Help information (plain mode)</h1>

  <p>This page gives general guidance on how to enter your answers to
  questions while using 'plain mode'. It does not provide help with the
  subject matter of the questions. In plain mode there is no javascript
  and no text styling. Most importantly, input is simplified so that it
  easier to navigate without using a mouse or when using a screenreader.
  You can use Tab and Shift-Tab to move (forwards and backwards) between
  the buttons, links and boxes used for input. Formulae and graphics are
  replaced by text equivalents.</p>

  <p>There are some questions that are not available in plain mode because
  they require graphics or the use of a mouse. If you have informed the
  university that you need to use plain mode, then your marks may be
  adjusted to take account of the fact that such a question is not available
  in plain mode.</p>

  <p>If you are using a screenreader it is important that you read the whole
  question before entering or selecting your answer. This is because on some
  types of question, particularly those with drop-down lists, the screenreader
  may stop reading at, for example the drop down list, and not read any text 
  that is located after the list.</p>

  <p>Note that the labels on some buttons in your test may differ from the
  exact text given here, for example 'enter answer' instead of 'check'. The
  buttons still function in the same way.</p>

  <h2>Entering your answers</h2>

  <p>In many questions you will be asked to type your answer into one or
  more text fields. Use the Tab to move to the relevant text field and type
  your answer. Screenreaders may call these fields 'edit boxes'.</p>

  <p>If you are using a screenreader you will need to switch modes in order
  to type in a text field. With JAWS you will need to switch to "forms mode".
  To switch to forms mode use Tab to move to the text field, then press return
  to switch modes. You can then type your answer. Once you have switched modes
  you can tab to other text fields and type answers as required. When you select
  the check button to submit your answer the screenreader will probably switch
  back to normal mode, but this depends on your screenreader settings. If this
  is the case you will need to switch modes again the next time you need to type
  in a text field.</p>

  <p>Sometimes you need to enter superscripts and/or subscripts. You can include
  superscripted text in your answer by typing '{' before the text to be
  superscripted and '}' afterwards (both without the quotes). Similarly, to enter
  a subscript place '[' and ']' before and after the subscript. For example, 10{3}
  would specify 10 to the power of 3, and A[i] would specify A with the subscript i.</p>

  <p>To enter a number in scientific notation you can write the multiplication as
  an upper or lower case letter X or as *.</p>

  <p>You may also wish to enter fractions. To do so you should use the / key on
  your keyboard. For example, if you want to enter a half then you should type
  1/2. Do not use superscripts or subscripts to enter fractions.</p>

  <p>Negative numbers and subtractions can be indicated using the '-' (hyphen,
  short dash or minus) key.</p>

  <h2>Using radio buttons</h2>

  <p>Some questions include radio buttons which require you to choose one option
  from several possibilities. To select a box, use the Tab key to move to the
  radio buttons and then use the left and right arrow keys to change which option
  is selected.</p>

  <h2>Using tick boxes</h2>

  <p>Some questions require you to choose one or more options using tick boxes.
  If you are using a screenreader it may call tick boxes checkboxes. To tick a
  box, use the Tab key to move to the box and press the space bar. To deselect
  (untick) a ticked box, Tab to it and press the space bar again.</p>

  <h2>Dragging boxes</h2>

  <p>Some questions ask you to drag boxes to blank areas. In 'plain mode' the
  blank areas are replaced by drop-down lists. Press Tab (or Shift-Tab) until
  the relevant drop-down list is highlighted. Then use the up and down arrow keys
  to move up and down the list of options for that area.</p>

  <p>If you are using a screenreader you will need to switch modes, as described
  above, in order to use the drop-down lists. Tab to the drop-down list, press
  return, and then you can use the arrow keys to scroll through the list.</p>

  <h2>Checking your answer</h2>

  <p>If you are using a screenreader it is particularly important to make sure
  that you have read the whole question. This is because on some types of question,
  particularly those with drop-down lists, the screenreader may stop reading
  before the end of the question. For example, it may stop at a drop down list,
  and not read any text that is located after the list.</p>

  <p>Click on <em>check</em> when want the system to check your answer. Make
  sure that your answer to the question says exactly what you want it to say
  before clicking on <em>check</em> (and be careful not to click on <em>check</em>
  by mistake). You will be given feedback on your answer. Click on
  <em>try again</em> to attempt the question again. Click on <em>next</em> to
  move on to the next question.</p>

  <h2>Ending the test</h2>

  <p>When you have completed the last question you will
  be asked whether you want to submit all your answers as a completed test.
  (If you have done the last question out of order you may well wish to return
  to the test instead of doing this.) You can also use the <em>End test</em>
  button to do this before you have attempted all the questions. In either
  case, you will be shown a summary of your answers and asked to confirm that
  you really want to end the test and submit all your answers as a completed
  test. Click on the <em>Submit</em> button to do this. Your answers will not
  be officially marked and counted towards your course result until you click
  on this button.</p>

  <h2>Progress so far</h2>

  <p>Below the question itself, there is a section titled <em>Progress so
  far.</em> This shows links to all the questions and information screens
  and indicates for each question whether it has been 'done' or 'not done'.
  It is recommended that you progress through the test by clicking on the
  Next button, however it may be possible to jump to any question at any
  time using this list. If you do jump to a question then the question you
  are currently attempting will <em>not</em> be marked as <em>done</em> and
  you can attempt it later. This allows you to do questions in a different
  order and perhaps to do a question again (if the test allows it).</p>

  <h2>Leaving Plain Mode</h2>

  <p>You can leave plain mode using the link at the bottom of every page.</p>
