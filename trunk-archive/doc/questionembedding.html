<p>
To embed questions you need to begin by setting up (in the <b>testbank</b> folder of
an Om server) a single-question deploy file
for the question concerned. This controls access to the question.
</p>
<p>
There should be only one deploy file per question. If you need to extend access
to an existing question, do so by adding more access entries into the existing
file rather than creating a new file. This means that it's easy to see who has
access to each question.
</p>
<p>
The file should be
named q.<b>samples.camera</b>.deploy.xml (assuming samples.camera is the
ID of your question). Here is a minimal deploy file for public, world-accessible
questions:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;deploy>
	&lt;question><b>samples.camera</b>&lt;/question>
	&lt;access>&lt;users world="yes"/>&lt;/access>
	&lt;dates>&lt;open>yes&lt;/open>&lt;/dates>
&lt;/deploy>
</pre>
<p>
After setting up the deploy file on a server you can test it by
visiting the URL directly: <a href="https://students.open.ac.uk/openmark/q.samples.camera/">https://students.open.ac.uk/openmark/<b>q.samples.camera</b>/</a>
for the live server, or <a href="http://kestrel.open.ac.uk/om-tn/q.samples.camera/">http://kestrel.open.ac.uk/om-tn/<b>q.samples.camera</b>/</a>
for the Kestrel test server.
</p>
<p>
Once you know the deploy file works, use the following code to embed the camera sample into
an ordinary web page:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;iframe src="https://students.open.ac.uk/openmark/<b>q.samples.camera</b>/"
  width="<b>620</b>" height="<b>536</b>" frameborder="0">
  &lt;a href="https://students.open.ac.uk/openmark/<b>q.samples.camera</b>/">Interactive question&lt;/a>
&lt;/iframe>
</pre>
<p>
You need to specify:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>deploy file</b> for the question, <b>q.samples.camera</b>.deploy.xml in
this case.</li>
<li>Iframe <b>width</b>. Standard Om questions are currently required to be 600
pixels wide (two columns totalling 592 pixels plus an 8 pixel margin). You must
add a further 20 pixels, making <b>620</b>.</li>
<li>Iframe <b>height</b>. Om questions can be of any height. Take the
height specified in question.xml (total all the row heights, then add 8 pixels
for each margin between multiple rows). Add <b>48</b> pixels to find the minimum
height.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that the height and width requirements are different for each browser, but
these settings allow space for both (I think). Also note that if users choose
'display options' and make the font bigger, they will have to scroll within
the same area. Unfortunately this cannot be avoided. Where accessibility is
paramount, use a full test, or provide a separate direct link to the question.
