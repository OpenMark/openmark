<h1>Development ideas</h1>

<p>These are some ideas for things it would be nice to have, but which we are unlikely 
to have time to work on at the OU.</p>

<h2>Support for other databases</h2>

<p>Support for different databases is via subpackages of tnavigator.db. At the moment we
only support Postgres and Microsoft SQL Server. To support a new database you just need to
write an SQL file to create the tables, and a subclass of OmQueries to rewrite any queries where
the standard SQL in OmQueries does not work. It would be good to offer support for MySQL.</p>

<h2>Support for other authentication systems</h2>

<p>At the moment, OpenMark integrates with the Open University's in-house
authentication system, which is non-standard, and offers an extremely basic
database table user lookup. We need plugins to support other standards-based 
authentication systems and databases.</p>

<h2>Support for other web browsers</h2>

<p>At the moment, Firefox 1.5+ and Internet Explorer 6.0+ are fully supported, which 
covers more than 90% of the web population, and most things work in other browsers with
good standards support like Safari/KHTML and Opera, but with a few layout differences.
It would be nice to document exactly what works in each browser, and then work to fix any
problems. This would mostly involves changes in the stdcomponent package, and in navigator.css.</p>

<h2>Anything else you would like to work on</h2>

<p>Please feel free to scratch your own itches, but we request that you contact us before 
starting work, so we can talk about how what you want to do fits in with our overall plans.</p>
