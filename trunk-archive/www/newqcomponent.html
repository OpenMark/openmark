<h1>How to create a new question component</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>New question component should probably be created in package om.stdcomponent.
You need a new class that is a subclass of om.stdquestion.QComponent,
typically called SomethingComponent, and then you need to edit
om.stdcomponent.ComponentRegistry to add your class to the COMPONENTCLASSES array.
In addition to the SomethingComponent.java file, you may also have one or both of a
SomethingComponent.js and a SomethingComponent.css file for Javascript and styles.
If either of these exist, the question engine automatically proesses them for you.</p>

<p>Now you actually need to implement the funcitonality of your new question component, 
and there are four parts to this described in the sections below. This is just a very
brief overview of what you need to do. To actually do it, the only way to learn is to
look at how other components work, and copy them.</p>
