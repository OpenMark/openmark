                The data below is to be plotted on a graph on the graph paper on the right,
                to show clearly the trend in average room temperature in a particular office
                in __month__ during the working day.

                    The temperature goes from __X1__°C to __X7__°C.
                    This is a range of 6°C.
                    There are 7 divisions on the y-axis and so 1°C per division is best,
                    starting at __X1__°C, for convenience.
                    The time of day goes from 8 to 18 hours, this is a range of 10 hours.
                    There are only 7 divisions and so not enough for one hour per division.
                    However 2 hours per division is possible and should show the trend well.
