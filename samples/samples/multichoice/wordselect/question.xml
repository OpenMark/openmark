				Remember that finite verbs can change from singular to plural
				(e.g. is - are), or from present to past tense (e.g. come - came),
				whereas non-finite verbs are not marked for number or for tense.
				The exceptions are modal verbs and imperatives, which are always
				finite even when they do not show number/tense.
