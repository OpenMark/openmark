# This file contains all the properties that control the behaviour of build.xml.
# Do not edit this file. Instead, create a file build.local.properties, and
# put in there overridden values for any properties you want to change.


##### 1. Prerequisite locations
# You definitely need to set the following properties.

# Modify Axis home. Should point to an Axis 1.4 install on the build
# machine. Used to obtain Axis lib files.
axishome=

# Location of theJava Activation Framework install, used for activation.jar.
jafhome=

# Location of theJava Mail install, used for mail.jar.
javamailhome=

# Location of the servlet-api.jar file. If you are using Tomcat,
# this should be set to [tomcathome]/common/lib
servletapi=

# Location of thethe xerces jars.
xerceshome=

# Location of theJEuclid jars, required for MathML component. These jars should
# come from jeuclid-minimal-3.1.5\repo.
jeuclidhome=

# Location of thejazzy-core.jar file.
jazzyhome=

# Location of postgresql-8.2-505.jdbc3.jar file.
postgresqlhome=

# Location of MS SQL server jar files.
sqlserverhome=


##### 2. Other locations
# On a Unix/OS X machine, the following properties may be OK, but you might
# want to configure them.

# Specify the desired build folder. This folder is COMPLETELY DELETED each
# time you build! Please bear that in mind.
build=/tmp/om-build

# Alter where the results of the 'javadoc' target are built to.
# This folder is COMPLETELY DELETED when you build the javadoc target.
javadoc=${build}/javadoc


##### 3 Developer servlet defaults
# These just set up options in the devservlet's web.xml file. They default
# to options that should work on your machine, but may not be appropriate
# for question author machines, so change if needed. You can also directly
# modify the devservlet's web.xml after building.

# Modify JDK home if necessary - this sets the default for the developer
# servlet, to make life easier for question developers.
jdkhome=${java.home}

# Modify Ant home if necessary - this sets the default for the developer
# servlet, to make life easier for question developers. Should point to
# an Ant 1.7 install on developer machines.
anthome=${ant.home}


##### 4. Settings relating to deployment tasks.

# If you want to use the localhost-install task, then set this
# to the path to your Tomcat webapps folder.
localhostwebapps=


##### 5. Things you don't need to change.
# Don't mess with these unless you know what you're doing.

# If building the equationgrammar target (not necessary unless altering
# grammar), you need to install JavaCC and put its location here
javacchome=

# URL of our dev.java.net project.
projecturl=https://openmark.dev.java.net/
